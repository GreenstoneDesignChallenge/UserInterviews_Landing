      <p className="pad">  Creating any product takes a deep understanding of who you are designing for and the value you are trying to create. While the scope of this design challenge could be taken in multiple directions, I used a thinking framework to drive a grounded plan to address:</p>
      <li className="pad"> Meaningful Health Overview</li>
      <li className="pad"> Digitized Health Records</li>
      <li className="pad"> Health Dashboard</li>
    <p className="small pad">As as producer, I have to be able to take insights gained from this UX-discovery stage and incorporate all stake-holder perspectives into a holistic plan. </p>
  <p className=" pad">Human-to-human relationship is critical in desiging anything, so I look forward to walking you through my approach. With that said, I hope the following research, insights, and mockups display my experience, understanding, and aptitude in the areas of UX-Design and production.</p>
